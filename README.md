Hello there ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹
+ This repository is meant to act as a journal, notebook, or record of my progress throughout my learning process ðŸ““ 
+ I've included notes/comments expressing my understanding of the concepts, references to official documentation, and loads of fun exercisesâ€”all while working with real-world Datasets.  
+ What's the end goal after this, you might ask? This should be a launchpad from which I wish to land softly into Machine Learning.

## Tools âš’
1. [Google Colab](https://colab.google/) - A hosted Jupyter Notebook service by Google.
2. [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) - A comprehensive library for making static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
3. [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) - A Python data visualization library based on Matplotlib.
4. [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/index.html) - An open-source data analysis and manipulation tool built on top of Python programming language.


## Datasets ðŸ“š
+ Due to the substantial size of the Datasets used, the datasets could not be included here ðŸ’”
+ However, they can be downloaded from the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) website.

# Hello there ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹

This repository is meant to act like a journal / notebook / record for my progress throughout my learning process.  


I've included notes / comments expressing my understanding of the concepts, references to official documentations, and loads of fun exercises - all the while, working with real-word Datasets.  


What's the end goal after this, you might ask? This should be a launchpad from which I wish to land softly into Machine Learning.
